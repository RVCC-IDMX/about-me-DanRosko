## About the project
The About Me project is a peak into my life while using the skill I have learned throughout the semester to create a working and user friendly website. Over the course of this semester I have learned many skills that have improved my webpage design skills and this project gave the opportunity to show those off. From creating a custom logo that is posted at the top left of my page to a fully functional nav bar that can send you to any point you would like on the screen. I gain a lot of experience and learned a lot, I went from having no web page dev experience to being able to publish a website to the web and fill that site with my own work and writing, videos and pictures and make it how I want it. One of the biggest and most important lessons was adjusting the padding and margins for each area that had text in it. Along side making everything look pleasing with proper spacing, adding designs was very fun during the process. Adding borders and shadows behind picture and objects as well as styling pictures with various Image Hover Effect. This entire process was not easy however. Most of it is just trial and error and trying different things over and over again until you can get it right. 

### Color scheme 
For my color scheme, I always like when warm colors are paired with cool colors so that is the theme I went with, but over the course of making this webpage I learned it is difficult to use all of the color you want while also being within range of accessibility checker.

The main colors I used are:
#51A7E8
#052d4b
#6d059d
#6B66ED
#E89351
