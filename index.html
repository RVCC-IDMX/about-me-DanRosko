            <h2>Image Hover Effects</h2>

            <div>
                <p>When it comes to adding more style to your web page, a great way to add some more life to it is through Images Hover Effects. Not only are they simple to add, but there are a wide variety of effects to choose from that add a subtle addition to your web page while at the same time greatly increasing the appeal of the site. As you read further, I will be discussing the uses of Images Hover Effects while providing a demonstration of how to your your own effects. As I said before, there are many different effects to choose from when it comes to Image Hover Effects, for this example, I will only be focusing on adding a shadow to an image and having the image change from black and white to color when hovered over. </p>

                <p>First, lets take a look at how we can make a border appear around our image so that when we hover over it, it looks like the image raises up a little. To do this we create a box shadow and add multiple layers which will become our shadow behind the image.</p>

                <img src="img/hoverborder_640w.jpg" alt="code screenshot border">
                
                <p>What really happening here is the image is moving over slightly and there are borders appearing to make it look like the photo is raising upwards. One detail I found is that if all the layers are different colors instead of one color for all, it make it look like the image is stacked on top of a bunch of other photos.</p>

                <img src="img/grayscale100_640w.jpg" alt="image color fade code">
                <img src="img/grayscale0_640w.jpg" alt="image color return code">

                <p>Now, making an image go from black and white into color is also very simple and add a sleek look to the webpage. We start by adding a grayscale over the image at 100% so that it is completely black and white. To undo that when we hover, we make it so that the grayscale takes 1 second to go back to 0% and when we stop hovering over the image, the grayscale takes 1 second to return back to 100%. To see all of these Image Hover Effects in action, check out my photo gallery that is just above this blog post.</p>
